# what is Local Are Network
A Local area network (LAN) is a network that is used to link devices in a single office, building, or campus of up to a short distance. LAN is restricted in size.

Imagine your home Wi-Fi network. All the devices connected to it, like your computer, phone, or smart TV, form a LAN. They can share files, printers, and internet access, making it easy to work and play together.

LANs are convenient because they allow devices to communicate quickly and efficiently, without needing to go through the internet. Itâ€™s like having your own private neighborhood of connected gadgets.


# How do LANs Work?
A router serves as the hub where the majority of LANs connect to the Internet. Home LANs often utilise a single router, but bigger LANs may also use network switches to transmit packets more effectively.
# What is a Virtual LAN?
The same physical network can have its traffic divided into two networks using virtual LANs, or VLANs.

to setup VLANs, it would be necessary a managed switch, with proper software configure devices to be part of the same logical virtual LAN.

VLANs are beneficial for network management, particularly in very large LANs. Administrators may much more simply control the network by segmenting it. (Subnets, another method of segmenting networks for increased efficiency, differ greatly from VLANs.)
